# Charred Desert

Interesting modules for [VCVRack](https://github.com/vcvrack/rack).

The name is an homage to [FrozenWasteland](https://github.com/almosteric/FrozenWasteland),
@almosteric's esoteric module set.

This is a growing work in progress, with only a couple of utility modules currently.
More modules will be added, so if you are interested in following along, either
star the repo, or keep checking back.

## Current Modules

![DTMF](docs/images/dtmf.png)![Noise](docs/images/noise.png)![CVSeq](docs/images/cvseq.png)![Not](docs/images/not.png)

* DTMF - plays DTMF tones as notes
* Noise - plays white or pink noise
* CVSeq - sends selectable CV values ("voltages") in order
* Not - switchable to invert either waveforms (-5 to 5) or CV (0 to 10)

For more information, see the [documentation](docs/README.md).
